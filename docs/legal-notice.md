# Legal Notice

CuMetal is a clean-room implementation. This document explains the project's legal posture
with respect to NVIDIA's CUDA EULA and Apple's AIR ABI.

---

## NVIDIA CUDA EULA — Translation Layer Warning

As of 2024, NVIDIA's CUDA EULA contains a clause prohibiting the use of translation layers
to run CUDA code on non-NVIDIA hardware. This clause applies to **binary drop-in shims**
that intercept CUDA API calls and redirect them to non-NVIDIA GPU backends (e.g., loading
a replacement `libcuda.dylib` that intercepts fatbinary registration).

**This clause does NOT apply to source-level recompilation.**

| Usage Model | Legal Risk | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| Recompile `.cu` source with `cumetalc` | **None** — you compiled your own source code with a different compiler | Primary recommended path |
| Link open-source CUDA programs against `libcumetal.dylib` | **Low** — no NVIDIA binary involved | Research and personal projects |
| Drop-in `libcuda.dylib` for closed-source PTX-shipping binaries | **High** — may violate NVIDIA EULA | Opt-in only; use at own risk |
| Drop-in for closed-source SASS-only binaries | Not supported | SASS is not translatable |

CuMetal's binary shim (`libcuda.dylib`) is provided as an opt-in convenience and is
**disabled by default** (`CUMETAL_ENABLE_BINARY_SHIM=OFF` in release builds). Its use
is at the user's own discretion and risk.

## Clean-Room Implementation

**No NVIDIA headers are shipped.** CuMetal's `cuda.h` and `cuda_runtime.h` are clean-room
implementations that match the public CUDA API specification without copying any NVIDIA
source material. Contributors are required to confirm clean-room status via CLA.

**No SASS decompilation.** CuMetal processes only PTX (NVIDIA's documented virtual ISA),
not SASS (native GPU machine code). PTX is a stable, documented, publicly specified
intermediate representation. No proprietary internal NVIDIA specifications are required.

**No NVIDIA source code was used.** The runtime shim, compiler passes, and PTX parser
were written without reference to any NVIDIA proprietary source. The PTX parser is derived
from the ZLUDA project's `ptx` crate (Apache 2.0), which is itself a clean-room parser.

## Apple AIR ABI

CuMetal generates `.metallib` files that conform to Apple's AIR (Apple Intermediate
Representation) ABI. This ABI was reverse-engineered from publicly distributed Apple
toolchain outputs (`.metallib` files produced by `xcrun metal`). No Apple proprietary
source code was accessed or copied.

**Legal basis for interoperability reverse engineering:**

- **United States**: *Sega v. Accolade*, 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992) — reverse
  engineering for interoperability is fair use under U.S. copyright law. *Sony Computer
  Entertainment v. Connectix*, 203 F.3d 596 (9th Cir. 2000) — intermediate copying
  during reverse engineering is permissible when the final product contains no copied code.
- **European Union**: Directive 2009/24/EC, Article 6 — decompilation for interoperability
  is permitted without authorization from the rightholder when necessary to achieve
  interoperability of an independently created computer program.
- **Key distinction**: CuMetal does not decompile or redistribute any Apple binary. It
  generates new `.metallib` files that conform to the reverse-engineered ABI specification.
  No Apple code is included in CuMetal's output.

The AIR ABI reverse engineering is documented in `docs/air-abi.md` and builds on the
open-source community work of:
- [MetalLibraryArchive](https://github.com/YuAo/MetalLibraryArchive) (YuAo) — MIT license
- [MetalShaderTools](https://github.com/zhuowei/MetalShaderTools) (zhuowei)
- [DougallJ's Apple GPU ISA documentation](https://github.com/dougallj/applegpu)

## ZLUDA PTX Parser

The PTX parser is derived from the ZLUDA project's `ptx` crate, licensed under Apache 2.0.
ZLUDA is used with attribution. Modifications to the parser are maintained in CuMetal's
fork and may be contributed back upstream.

ZLUDA's CUDA EULA history: ZLUDA initially provided a binary drop-in CUDA replacement for
AMD GPUs. AMD ceased funding ZLUDA in 2022 after NVIDIA added the translation-layer clause
to its EULA. CuMetal draws the same strategic lesson: the primary path is source
recompilation, not binary translation.

## Contributor License Agreement

All contributors must sign a CLA confirming:

1. The contributed code is a clean-room implementation — no NVIDIA proprietary source
   material was referenced or copied.
2. No prior exposure to NVIDIA proprietary source code for the implemented API surface.
3. The contribution is original work or is properly attributed open-source code.
